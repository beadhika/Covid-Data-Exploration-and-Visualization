# Covid-Data-Exploration-and-Visualization

I used Covid-19 deaths and vaccinations data to perform Data Exploration in Microsoft SQL and Data Visualization in Tableau. The two datasets are included here as Excel Worksheets and originally reported from "Our World in Data" (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The sequel queries for Data Exploration are also included here in "Covid Data Exploration in SQL" file. 
These queries for data exploration help further in creating visualization and Tableau dashboard (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benjan.adhikari/viz/CovidDashboard_16844454866260/Dashboard1?publish=yes) .
